# SimonSays
Built a Simon Says Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ! It's a simple memory game where players repeat sequences of colors that get longer with each round. The project helped me improve my skills in handling user interactions, DOM manipulation, and game logic.

**HOW TO RUN:**
Clone the repo : 

git clone https://github.com/KaveriBadakh0604/SimonSays.git

and simply run HTML file.
no need for any other installations as it is just simple project built using HTML, CSS and JS.
